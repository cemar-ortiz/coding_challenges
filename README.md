# About this project

On July 2021, as I was having dinner with some dear friends, we were discussing how nice and useful it is to know about data structures and algorithms. As it happenned, we were all developers and as the dinner went on we agreed that it would be fun to start a coding community where we could work on coding challenges, share our results, discuss, teach and feedback each other. In this repository I will be uploading and updating my solutions to such exercises, implemented with Python.
