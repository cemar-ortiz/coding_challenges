# Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters ('aaabbbbcc' should become 'a2b4c2'). If the output is not 'smaller' than the input, it should return the input. Assume only letters will be used as input, uppercase or lowercase.


def task(string: str):
	return 'dummy string'
